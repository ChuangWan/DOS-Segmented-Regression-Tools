# DOSI-SLM-SegmentedOut
Takes DOSI data, runs Matlab threshold analysis via SLM, then outputs CSVs for threshold analysis in R via 'Segmented'.

Segmented Analysis.R runs the threshold analysis in R. Requires matching exercise data. See script comments for specifics. There is another version of the script if you want to run the analysis without matching exercise data - that script will provide basic figure outputs only and no workbook output.
