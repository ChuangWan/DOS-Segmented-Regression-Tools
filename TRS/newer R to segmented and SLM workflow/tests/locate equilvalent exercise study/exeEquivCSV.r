# Function to locate equivalent exercise
# 	Given an input of study name:
#		Split it by spaces, then compare with other studies in the file-list
#		until EXE study with same EXO, date, & visit is found
#		Meant to be used in relation to an index of optical data
#	Output: index of exercise study in relation to total csv
